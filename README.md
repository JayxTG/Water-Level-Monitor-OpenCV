# Water Level Detection

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a real-time water level detection system using a webcam and computer vision techniques. The system captures video frames, processes each frame to detect water levels, and displays the water level on the frame. It uses simple image processing techniques like grayscale conversion, thresholding, and contour detection to identify and highlight the water level in the video feed.

## üéØ Objective

The objective of this project is to create an automated system that can detect water levels in real-time, providing a potential tool for monitoring water levels in tanks, reservoirs, or other relevant applications.

## üîë Key Features

- üé• Real-time water level detection using a webcam
- üåä Drawing contours around detected water levels
- üõ†Ô∏è Simple thresholding and contour detection algorithm
- üö® Displaying visual feedback when water levels are detected

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware:
- Webcam

### Software:
- OpenCV
- ![OpenCV](https://img.shields.io/badge/opencv-%23white.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=opencv&logoColor=white)
- NumPy


## üì∏ Sample Usage
**Detecting Falls**
Run the application, and it will start the webcam feed. The system will detect humans in the frame, draw stick figures around them, and display an alert if a fall is detected.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## üéõÔ∏è How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayxTG/Water-Level-Monitor-OpenCV.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
 Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

    ```
3. **Run the Application**
  Execute the main script to start the fall detection system:

   ```bash
   python src/fall_detection.py
   
    ```
